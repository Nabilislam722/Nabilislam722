# üëã Hello

Hi, I'm Nabil. I'm from Bangladesh. And fun fact: I don't know what to call myself because I'm curious about so many things! I‚Äôm currently exploring **embedded systems programming** and **reverse engineering**. I‚Äôm passionate about understanding how modern technology works, particularly **CPUs**, **assembly language**, and how **electromagnetic waves** (like **radio**, **military-grade jammers**, **radar**, and **fighter jets**) are utilized.  

I'm also fascinated by **space exploration** and always on a quest for the unknown. My hobbies include **programming**, **FPV drones**, **computers**, **electronics circuits**, **cryptocurrency**, **traveling**, and **watching anime**. I‚Äôm searching for new knowledge in areas like **deep learning** on **ALUs**, control panels, and how logic gates are built in modern CPUs.

I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on **kernel and OS design**, as well as **software development**. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate. I'm always open to learning and contributing to exciting projects.
